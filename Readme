# Resume and Job Description Compatibility Checker

This project compares a resume with a job description (JD) to compute a similarity score, helping candidates tailor their resumes for specific job roles. It uses simple NLP techniques to calculate the match percentage between two `.docx` files (one resume and one JD).

# Features

- Reads both resume and JD from `.docx` format
- Cleans and vectorizes text using `CountVectorizer`
- Computes cosine similarity between resume and JD
- Outputs a match percentage.




#Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `docx2txt` for reading `.docx` files
- `scikit-learn` for text vectorization and similarity calculation

#Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or just place your files in a folder):
